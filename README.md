# EnergyEconomics2025
Repo for energy economics paper. A bunch of models exist here for different applications following theory in the paper.
Original theoretical model in "Model.ipynb"


### Documentation
- Rasmus' original documentation is here (pending change).
- Mostly for theoretical justification behind **lpSolve** and "blocks".

### Data
- See the `DownloadDataForDK` folder (pending change).

### pySolv Models
- Various iterations and testbeds for different linear programming implementations (i.e., to solve maximization problems).
- **Note:** Some of these may be used in the final implementation.

### DownloadDataForDK
- Helpful guide by Rasmus to download energy data for Europe and Denmark.

### Project
- Main project folder. Contains all necessary supporting code/data and can be run independently.
  - `Project/Project/Main.ipynb`: Contains all solving and visualizations for each scenario.
  - `Project/Data`: Contains all the necessary simulation data.



TODO's
- Change lpSolve to suit wider conditions (battery storage etc.)
- Investigate other lpModels that can further suit our conditions (tied in with above)
- Download more data from Entsoe etc. 
- Make new Documentation with added features/for other implementation as well.
