# EnergyEconomics2025
Repo for energy economics paper. A bunch of models exist here for different applications following theory in the paper.
Original theoretical model in "Model.ipynb"


Documentation       - Rasmus' original documentation in here (pending change). Mostly for theoretical justification behind lpSolve and "blocks". 
Data                - See DownloadDataForDK folder (pending change)
pySolv Models       - Various Iterations and testbed for various linear programming implementations (i.e. to solve maximisation problems)
                      NOTE: Some of these may be used in final implementation
DownloadDataForDK   - Helpful guide by Rasmus to download energy data for Europe and Denmark. 
Project             - Main Project File. Contains all necessary supporting code/data and can be run isolated. 
                          - Project\Project\Main.ipynb contains all solving and visualisations for each scenario. 
                          - Project\Data is all the necessary simulation data


TODO's
- Change lpSolve to suit wider conditions (battery storage etc.)
- Investigate other lpModels that can further suit our conditions (tied in with above)
- Download more data from Entsoe etc. 
- Make new Documentation with added features/for other implementation as well.
